# Design Document

## Overview

This design document outlines the architectural changes needed to improve the Word Puzzle Game's user experience. The main focus is on restructuring the game layout to support scrollable content areas, fixed positioning for input controls, and enhanced game flow management. The design maintains backward compatibility while introducing new interaction patterns that improve usability across different devices and content lengths.

## Architecture

### Layout Structure Changes

The current layout uses a flex-based approach where all elements are contained within a single game container. The new design introduces a three-tier layout structure:

1. **Header Area**: Fixed position containing home button, lives display, and progress indicator
2. **Content Area**: Scrollable area containing source display and problem area
3. **Footer Area**: Fixed position containing the virtual keyboard

### Component Hierarchy

```
game-screen
├── game-header (fixed)
│   ├── home-button
│   ├── lives-display
│   └── progress-indicator (new)
├── game-content (scrollable)
│   ├── source-display
│   └── problem-area
└── game-footer (fixed)
    ├── hint-controls (new)
    └── keyboard-area
```

## Components and Interfaces

### 1. Layout Manager

**Purpose**: Manages the three-tier layout structure and handles responsive behavior.

**Key Methods**:
- `initializeLayout()`: Sets up the new layout structure
- `adjustForMobile()`: Applies mobile-specific layout adjustments
- `handleResize()`: Responds to viewport changes

**CSS Classes**:
- `.game-header`: Fixed header with flex layout
- `.game-content`: Scrollable content area with overflow handling
- `.game-footer`: Fixed footer with keyboard controls

### 2. Progress Tracker

**Purpose**: Tracks and displays user progress through the game session.

**Properties**:
- `currentProblem`: Current problem index
- `totalProblems`: Total problems in session
- `completedProblems`: Array of completed problem IDs

**Methods**:
- `updateProgress(current, total)`: Updates progress display
- `markComplete(problemId)`: Marks a problem as completed
- `reset()`: Resets progress for new session

### 3. Game Flow Manager

**Purpose**: Manages game state transitions and user choices after success/failure.

**States**:
- `PLAYING`: Normal game state
- `REVIEW`: Post-success review state
- `RETRY_PROMPT`: Post-failure retry prompt state

**Methods**:
- `handleSuccess()`: Shows success modal with review options
- `enterReviewMode()`: Switches to review mode
- `handleFailure()`: Shows failure modal with retry options
- `retryCurrentProblem()`: Resets current problem state

### 4. Hint System

**Purpose**: Provides progressive hints to help users when stuck.

**Properties**:
- `hintsUsed`: Number of hints used for current problem
- `maxHints`: Maximum hints available per problem
- `hintPenalty`: Score penalty per hint used

**Methods**:
- `provideHint()`: Reveals one correct letter
- `canUseHint()`: Checks if hints are available
- `calculateScore()`: Calculates final score with hint penalties

### 5. Touch Handler (Mobile)

**Purpose**: Handles mobile-specific touch interactions and gestures.

**Methods**:
- `handleSwipe(direction)`: Processes swipe gestures for blank navigation
- `provideTactileFeedback(type)`: Triggers haptic feedback
- `optimizeTouchTargets()`: Adjusts touch target sizes for mobile

## Data Models

### GameSession

```javascript
{
  id: string,
  category: string,
  problems: Problem[],
  currentIndex: number,
  startTime: Date,
  completedProblems: string[],
  totalScore: number
}
```

### ProblemState

```javascript
{
  problemId: string,
  blanks: BlankState[],
  hintsUsed: number,
  attempts: number,
  completed: boolean,
  score: number
}
```

### BlankState

```javascript
{
  index: number,
  correctChar: string,
  userInput: string,
  isCorrect: boolean,
  isActive: boolean
}
```

## Error Handling

### Layout Errors
- **Viewport too small**: Graceful degradation with minimum viable layout
- **Content overflow**: Automatic scrolling with visual indicators
- **Touch target conflicts**: Priority system for overlapping elements

### Game Flow Errors
- **Invalid state transitions**: State validation with fallback to safe states
- **Progress tracking failures**: Local storage backup with recovery mechanisms
- **Hint system failures**: Graceful degradation to basic gameplay

### Mobile-Specific Errors
- **Haptic feedback unavailable**: Silent fallback without user notification
- **Gesture conflicts**: Priority system favoring game interactions over browser defaults
- **Virtual keyboard interference**: Dynamic layout adjustment

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Layout Manager component isolation testing
- Progress Tracker state management testing
- Game Flow Manager state transition testing
- Hint System logic and scoring testing

### Integration Tests
- Layout responsiveness across different screen sizes
- Game flow transitions between all states
- Touch gesture recognition and response
- Keyboard interaction with scrollable content

### User Experience Tests
- Usability testing on mobile devices
- Accessibility testing for touch targets
- Performance testing with long sentences
- Cross-browser compatibility testing

### Visual Regression Tests
- Layout consistency across viewport sizes
- Animation smoothness during state transitions
- Modal positioning and overlay behavior
- Keyboard fixed positioning verification

## Implementation Considerations

### CSS Architecture
- Use CSS Grid for the three-tier layout structure
- Implement CSS custom properties for consistent spacing
- Utilize CSS scroll-behavior for smooth scrolling
- Apply CSS containment for performance optimization

### JavaScript Architecture
- Maintain existing module structure while adding new components
- Use event delegation for touch gesture handling
- Implement state machine pattern for game flow management
- Add debouncing for resize and scroll event handlers

### Performance Optimization
- Lazy load hint system components
- Use CSS transforms for smooth animations
- Implement virtual scrolling for very long sentences
- Cache layout calculations to avoid reflow

### Accessibility Considerations
- Maintain keyboard navigation support
- Ensure proper ARIA labels for new components
- Provide alternative interaction methods for gestures
- Test with screen readers for layout changes
